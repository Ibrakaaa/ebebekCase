#  Salary Calculator 

**Course Name** : ebebek Java&QA Practicum

**Type** : First Case 

**Language** : Java 

**Case Detail** :
You should write a class called "Employee" that represents factory workers and calculates employee salaries with its 
methods. This class will have 4 attributes and 5 methods. Expected outputs: name ,salary, work hours(weekly), hire year,
tax, bonus ,salary raise, salary with bonuses and taxes and total salary. 

#### Attributes of the Class

* **name** : Employee's first and last name

* **salary**: The employee's salary

* **workHours**: Weekly working hours

* **hireYear** : Year of employment


#### Methods of the Class

* **Employee(name,salary,workHours,hireYear)** : It is a constructor method and will take 4 parameters.

* **tax()** : It will calculate the tax applied to the salary.

  -If the employee's salary is less than 1000 TL, no tax will be applied.

  -If the employee's salary is more than 1000 TL, 3% of his salary will be taxed.
* **bonus()** : If the employee has worked more than 40 hours a week, bonus wages will be calculated as 30 TL per hour 
of extra work.
* **raiseSalary()** : It will calculate the salary increase based on the employee's start year. Take the current year 
as 2021.

    --If the employee has been working for less than 10 years, his salary will be increased by 5%.

    --If the employee has worked for more than 9 years and less than 20 years, his salary will be increased by 10%.

    --If the employee has been working for more than 19 years, a 15% raise will be made.

* **toString()** : It will print the information of the employee to the screen.

In addition of these methods I have created one more method to help calculate the salary raise and print the salary
taking into account bonuses and taxes on the console. 

* **netSalary()** : I will calculate the net salary taking into account bonuses and taxes.


As a final step I set up **Junit** test cases with the help of Maven dependencies.
